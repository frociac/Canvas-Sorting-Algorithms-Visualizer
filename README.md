### Explore Sorting Algorithms Through Visualization
This website employs JavaScript canvas to provide a display of some of the most widely used sorting algorithms in modern programming. The purpose of this visualization is to simplify the inner workings of these algorithms by using color-coded elements at a human-understable simulation speed.

### Color Legend
- **Yellow:** Comparisons
  - In the sorting process, comparisons with other elements are important to determine the correct arrangement of items.

- **Green:** Sorted Elements
  - Many sorting algorithms optimize their efficiency by placing elements in their appropriate positions early on. Various strategies exist to achieve this. Once an element is placed correctly, it turns green and is never compared again.
